# Microservices based Quiz Management System

 ## Description
 Quiz Management System is my very first microservice project which is chiefly designed by multiple enriching services, known as **account service** for user authentication and registeration using JWT.
 **user service** for user identification and profiles, **question service** for question configuration, interactive logics between question and quiz services. 
 Moroever, Quiz service is configured with OpenFeign, enhancing inter-service communications between other services and acting like replacement for RestTemplate or Webclient.
 **Score service** is also created to calculate scores of each user based on userId and scores of user based on both quiz and user ids. **Service registery** class uses eureka server to enable seamless discovery among eureka clients(microservices) 
 
## Key Features
- JWT based authentication and role-based access control.
- Feign Client for clean inter-service communication.
- Modular architecture: each service can be developed, maintained, and scaled independently.
- Fault isolation: when one service fails, only the responsible team needs to handle the error.

## Testing

This project includes **unit and integration tests** for different services to ensure reliability and correctness of business logic.
Tests are written using **JUnit 5 and Mockito** to mock dependencies such as repositories and Feign clients.

### Running Tests
From the root of each microservice, you can run:
``` mvn clean test```
or for all services at once (if you have a parent pom.xml):
```mvn clean install```

### Test Cover by Services
#### Account Service
- Integration tests for user registration and login endpoints.
#### Quiz Service
- Unit tests for quiz creation, fetching questions by quiz ID.
- Integration tests with mocked AccountService, User Service, Score Service validations (via Feign client).
#### Question Service
- Both Unit and Integration Tests, mainly fabricated to test methods which are essential for intergration between quiz and question services.
